# @centcom/api

The Fastify REST API (`/v1/*`, CT-API). It is assembled lane by lane; today it holds the request
context plugin (B005). Logging itself lives in `@centcom/core`
([`packages/core/README.md`](../../packages/core/README.md#logging-b005)).

## Request context plugin (B005)

`src/plugins/request-context.ts` gives every request a CT-IDS `req_` id, runs the request inside
the logging context, and writes one access-log line per request.

```ts
import { fastify } from 'fastify';
import { requestContextPlugin } from './plugins/request-context.js';

const app = fastify({ logger: false }); // the plugin and @centcom/core do the logging
await app.register(requestContextPlugin, { logger: log, metrics }); // first, before routes
```

| Option         | Default           | What it is                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `logger`       | (required)        | The service logger; writes the access log                          |
| `metrics`      | no-op             | Receives `http_requests_total` and `http_request_duration_seconds` |
| `newRequestId` | `newId('req')`    | Makes an id for a request without a valid `X-Request-Id`           |
| `clock`        | `performance.now` | Monotonic milliseconds, for `duration_ms`                          |

### Behaviour

- **Request id (CT-ERR rule 4).** A valid `req_` id in `X-Request-Id` is reused; anything else
  (missing, malformed, another prefix, lower case) is replaced by a new id. When the header is
  repeated, only its first value counts. The id is echoed in the `X-Request-Id` response header,
  on errors and 404s too, and is also set as Fastify's `request.id`.
- **Context.** Hooks, the handler and everything they start (awaits, timers, nested calls) see
  the id through `getRequestContext()`, so every log line they write carries `request_id`
  without passing it along. Fastify keeps the context across body parsing itself.
- **Access log.** One `info` line per request, `msg: "http.request"`, with `request_id`, `method`,
  `route` (the route template, such as `/v1/sessions/:id`; `(unmatched)` for a 404), `status`,
  `duration_ms` and `bytes` (when the response has a `Content-Length`). Never the raw URL, the
  query string, headers or bodies. A request the client abandons before the response gets one
  line with `status: 499` and `aborted: true`.
- **Metrics.** `http_requests_total{method, route, status_class}` and
  `http_request_duration_seconds{method, route}` (buckets 5 ms to 30 s). Labels use the route
  template only, never an id or raw path.

### Tests

- **`test/request-context.test.ts`:** id selection, echo and replacement, repeated headers (also
  on the wire), the context across `await`, timers, concurrent requests and body parsing
- **`test/access-log.test.ts`:** one line per request, the route template, no query values,
  headers or bodies, 404s and errors, metric labels, and abandoned requests over a real socket
